zodbdump
========

Tool to dump contents of a ZODB without the need to install any code from the application used to create the ZODB.

Core based on https://pypi.python.org/pypi/eye, which is also very useful in expanding and debugging the dump.

In case you get an error about unsupported version info in your ZODB, this is helpful:
